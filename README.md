# sms-port

A native PC port of **Super Mario Sunshine** (GameCube, North America, GMSE01), built from the [matching decompilation](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-english).

No game data is included.
You build the program from source, and it reads the models, textures, levels, music and movies from **your own disc image** at run time.

For guided setup, updates and a Play button, use our dedicated [SMS Launcher](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-launcher) for Windows, macOS and Linux.
The launcher sets up this port on your computer using your own supported disc image; downloads are on its [releases page](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-launcher/releases/latest).

## Decompilation progress

![GMSE01 progress: fuzzy similarity, byte-perfect code, and source-linked code](assets/progress.svg)

This card shows the [GMSE01 decompilation](https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-english) snapshot recorded by the source revision pinned in this port.
Fuzzy similarity measures approximate code similarity; the other two tracks show byte-perfect code and code linked from matching source.

## Supported systems

| System | Word size | Status | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Linux (x86) | 32-bit (default) | plays | `build/linux-32/sms` |
| Linux (x86-64) | 64-bit (`SMS_ARCH=64`) | plays; still being tested stage by stage ([docs/64-BIT.md](docs/64-BIT.md)) | `build/linux-64/sms` |
| macOS (Intel, or Apple Silicon under Rosetta 2) | 64-bit | plays | `build/macos-64/sms` |
| Windows (MSYS2 MINGW64) | 64-bit | boots under Wine; native runtime checks | `build/windows-64/sms.exe` |

The game code keeps pointers in 4-byte fields, so it was written for a 32-bit machine.
The 64-bit builds keep every address the game sees below 4 GiB; see [docs/64-BIT.md](docs/64-BIT.md).

## Quick start

1. **Get the source**, including the decompilation submodule:

   ```sh
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/chasem-dev/sms-pc-port.git
   cd sms-pc-port
   ```

2. **Install the prerequisites** for your system: [Linux](BUILD.md#linux), [macOS](BUILD.md#macos), [Windows](BUILD.md#windows-msys2-mingw64).

3. **Put your disc image in [`rom/`](rom/)**: one `.iso`, `.gcm` or Dolphin `.ciso` of GMSE01 Rev 0.

4. **Build and play:**

   ```sh
   ./build.sh
   ./run.sh
   ```

   On Windows, run these in the MSYS2 MINGW64 shell, or run `.\build.cmd` and `.\run.cmd` from PowerShell.

The first build compiles about 600 game files and takes a while; later builds only rebuild what changed.
Because the image is in `rom/`, `./build.sh` also makes a **standalone** copy with the game's files inside (`sms-standalone`, or `SMS.app` on macOS) that runs without the image.
See [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#standalone-executable).

You can also keep the image elsewhere and pass it: `./run.sh "/path/to/Super Mario Sunshine (US).iso"`.

## Build and run

The same two scripts work on every system:

| Command | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `./build.sh [IMAGE]` | builds `build/<os>-<arch>/sms`; with an image (argument, `SMS_DISC_IMAGE`, or the one in `rom/`) also the standalone copy |
| `./run.sh [IMAGE] [--headless]` | runs that build: with the image you pass, else the standalone copy, else the image in `rom/` |
| `./clean.sh [--all] [--dry-run]` | deletes the build output (every `build/<os>-<arch>/`); never deletes your disc image, and keeps the downloaded SDL2; `--all` deletes all of `build/` |
| `SMS_ARCH=64 ./build.sh` | chooses the word size (Linux: `32` default or `64`; macOS: `64` only; Windows: `64` default (`32` legacy with MINGW32)) |
| `JOBS=2 ./build.sh` | limits parallel compiler jobs (default: all cores) |

`./build.sh --help`, `./run.sh --help` and `./clean.sh --help` print the details.
When both a 32-bit and a 64-bit build exist, `./run.sh` runs the 32-bit one unless `SMS_ARCH=64` is set.

## Options

Options can be kept in [`settings.txt`](settings.txt) (`resolution = 2`, `texture_packs = on`, ...), or set as environment variables before the command, for example `SMS_SKIP_MOVIES=1 ./run.sh`; an environment variable wins over the file:

| Option | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `SMS_SKIP_MOVIES=1` | skip the intro and opening movies |
| `SMS_AUDIO=0` | no sound |
| `SMS_VOLUME=n` | master volume, 0 to 100 (default 100) |
| `SMS_SAVE_DIR=dir` | memory card folder |
| `SMS_BINDINGS=file` | key bindings file (default `bindings.txt` in this folder) |
| `SMS_DISC_IMAGE=file` | disc image to use when none is passed |
| `--headless` (after the image) or `SMS_HEADLESS=1` | no window, for testing (Linux only) |
| `SMS_OVERLAY=1` | open the debug overlay at start |
| `SMS_GX_SCALE=n` | render at n times the GameCube's resolution |
| `SMS_NET_MODE=host` | online co-op: host (`join` with `SMS_NET_ADDRESS`), on UDP `SMS_NET_PORT` (27016), as `SMS_NET_NAME`; see [docs/ONLINE_COOP.md](docs/ONLINE_COOP.md) |
| `SMS_ANISO=n` | anisotropic filtering, 2 to 16 (up to what the GPU supports), for sharper textures at glancing angles |
| `SMS_FULLSCREEN=1` | borderless fullscreen at the desktop's resolution; `exclusive` switches the display to `SMS_FULLSCREEN_MODE=WxH@Hz` (else the desktop's mode). F11 or Alt+Enter toggles fullscreen while playing |
| `SMS_DISPLAY=n` | the monitor to open on (0 is the primary one; by default, the one under the mouse) |
| `SMS_VSYNC=1` | wait for the display's refresh; `adaptive` shows a late frame at once instead of waiting a whole refresh |
| `SMS_MSAA=n` | multisample anti-aliasing with 2, 4 or 8 samples (up to what the GPU supports) |
| `SMS_FXAA=1` | FXAA on the final picture, smoothing edges MSAA leaves (alpha-tested foliage, fences) |
| `SMS_SHARPEN=n` | contrast-adaptive sharpening of the final picture, 0 to 100 |
| `SMS_GAMMA=x` | brightness curve: 1.0 is unchanged, above 1 is brighter (0.3 to 3) |
| `SMS_ASPECT=stretch` | fill the window instead of keeping the picture's shape; `integer` keeps whole multiples of 640x528 |
| `SMS_PRESENT_FILTER=sharp` | scale the picture with crisp pixels (`nearest` for none at all; default `bilinear`, which averages when the internal resolution is above the window's) |
| `SMS_WIDESCREEN=16:9` | widescreen (also `21:9`, `16:10`): a wider view, with the HUD and menus kept 4:3 in the middle |
| `SMS_FRAME_RATE=60` | gameplay at 60 frames per second (the game's own timing, not sped up); logos, menus and movies stay at 30 |
| `SMS_WIDESCREEN_HUD=edges` | with widescreen, move the gameplay HUD's counters to the left edge and the water gauge to the right one |

Optional mods, such as HD texture packs, go in [`mods/`](mods/README.md); `python3 tools/mods/get.py textures` downloads and installs the UHD texture pack there.

Saves go to a memory card in slot A, kept as files in `~/.local/share/sms-port/card-a` on Linux and macOS (`$XDG_DATA_HOME/sms-port/card-a` if that is set) and in `%APPDATA%\sms-port\card-a` on Windows.
Every other switch (debugging, tracing, graphics) is listed in [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md#environment-variables).

## Frame rate

The game runs at 30 frames a second, and like on the GameCube a frame that takes longer than two retraces (33 ms) waits for the next one, so a slow frame shows as 20 or 15 fps rather than 28.
The debug overlay (backtick) shows where each frame's time goes:

- `game`: the game's own code (and the GX commands it writes).
- `GX`: the renderer, split into `vertices` (loading GX vertices), `batches` (issuing draws), `textures`, `copies` (EFB copies) and `peeks`.
  `waiting for the GPU` is the part of it spent blocked on the GPU.
- `present` and `swap`: drawing the frame to the window and `SDL_GL_SwapWindow`.
- `idle`: the game waiting for the next retrace, which is spare time.

If the overlay's `GL` line says `llvmpipe`, `softpipe` or `Software`, the game is rendering on the CPU and cannot hold 30 fps.
On Linux this is usually the 32-bit build without the GPU driver's 32-bit libraries; build 64-bit (`SMS_ARCH=64 ./build.sh`) or see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md#troubleshooting).

## Controls

Controller 1 reads the keyboard and any game controller SDL recognises (A/B/X/Y, Start, right shoulder = Z, triggers = L/R, sticks, d-pad).
Keyboard defaults:

| GameCube | Keys |
| --- | --- |
| Control stick | arrow keys or WASD (hold Left Ctrl for half tilt) |
| C-stick | I / J / K / L |
| A | Space or X |
| B | Shift or C |
| X / Y | V / F |
| Z | Z |
| L / R (full press) | Q / E |
| Start | Enter |
| D-pad | 1 2 3 4 (up, down, left, right) or keypad 8 2 4 6 |
| Debug overlay (frame rate, stats, keys) | ` (backtick) |
| Game and movie speed x1 / x2 / x4 / x10 (overlay open) | F7 |
| Quit | Esc |

To change them, edit [`bindings.txt`](bindings.txt) (`CONTROL = KEY KEY ...`, one control per line; a line replaces that control's defaults), or point `SMS_BINDINGS` at another file.

`SMS_CAMERA_INVERT_X=1` and `SMS_CAMERA_INVERT_Y=1` invert the C-stick's camera control left/right and up/down, for keys and controllers alike (recorded `.dtm` movies are played as recorded).
The launcher sets them from **Settings → Gameplay → Invert camera X / Y** (X on, Y off by default), effective on the next game launch.

`SMS_FREE_CAMERA=1` keeps the camera where you point it: it no longer swings back behind Mario by itself as he runs (L still recentres it). `SMS_CAMERA_SPEED=n` scales how fast the C-stick turns the camera, in percent (100 is the game's own; 10 to 400). `SMS_MOUSE_CAMERA=1` turns the camera with the mouse: the window captures the mouse while it has focus, F10 releases it and a click takes it back; `SMS_MOUSE_SENSITIVITY=n` sets its speed in percent. The invert settings apply to the mouse too.

On the file-select screen, walk Mario left under a block for about half a second and press A to jump into it.

- `platform/*/README.md`: each platform module in detail.

The standalone build contains the whole game, so keep it to yourself: sharing it is sharing the game.

## HD cutscenes

The optional HD pack enhances all 21 original movies at 3× resolution and preserves their timing and original audio. The updated launcher installs the movie patches from your own disc when **HD textures** are enabled.
See [HD cutscenes](docs/HD-CUTSCENES.md) for installation, conversion tools and playback checks.
